## Source Code for the Submission 29 titled "Counterfactual Explanations for Incomplete Inputs"

The entry point for running the code is the ```main``` method of ```calculate_ctx.py```. The Execution can be configured in ```Config.py```.
After running the experiment, the folder named ```experimental_results``` will contain all relevant information. Then, one of the corresponding python scripts (```visualize_plausibility_validity.py```, ```visualize_cost_valid_tradeoff.py```, ```read_detailed_report.py```) can be used to visualize the results.

The experimental results from the paper are included in the repository. See the respective folders for both the plots and the raw report data.
